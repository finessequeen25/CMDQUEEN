<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>More about Brandi..AKA the Command Queen. I have worked in customer service for the past 8 years. I have recently chose coding as a new career path.</p>

<p>What interests me about coding you may ask? Well the ability to create almost anything is what motivates me the most. But also the ability to control how things work on the backend is very intriguing to me.</p>

<p>With this new skill I can do endless things and make so many ideas come to life. I actually have a journal app I am currently working on along with a messaging app. I am still trying to decide which of the two do I want to take serious first. Overall I am enjoying this new world of code and I must say the feeling of getting your code to work after hours even days of not understanding whats wrong, has to be one of the greatest feelings.</p>
